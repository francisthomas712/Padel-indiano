# Padel Indiano Scoring Guide

## Overview

The Padel Indiano tournament uses a simple, point-based scoring system with service rotation.

## Match Scoring

### Points to Win
- **Default**: First team to **7 points** wins
- **Configurable**: Can be changed in Settings (range: 3-21 points)
- **No advantage**: First to reach the target wins (e.g., 7-6 is a valid final score)

### How Matches Work

1. **Starting a Match**
   - Both teams start at 0-0
   - Service starts with Pair 1, Player 1

2. **Scoring Points**
   - Use the +/- buttons to adjust scores
   - Each point won increases the team's score by 1

3. **Winning a Match**
   - First team to reach the "Points to Win" target wins
   - Examples (with default 7 points):
     - 7-0, 7-1, 7-2, 7-3, 7-4, 7-5, 7-6 are all valid winning scores
     - Maximum points played in a match: 13 (for a 7-6 game)

## Service Rotation

Service rotates **every point** in a fixed pattern:

### Rotation Order
1. **Pair 1, Player 1** serves
2. **Pair 2, Player 1** serves
3. **Pair 1, Player 2** serves
4. **Pair 2, Player 2** serves
5. Back to **Pair 1, Player 1**

### Visual Example

```
Point 1:  Pair 1-P1 serves
Point 2:  Pair 2-P1 serves
Point 3:  Pair 1-P2 serves
Point 4:  Pair 2-P2 serves
Point 5:  Pair 1-P1 serves (cycle repeats)
```

This ensures:
- Fair distribution of serves
- Both teams serve equally
- Both players on each team get equal service opportunities

## Tournament Scoring

### Regular Rounds
- All matches use the same "Points to Win" setting
- Each player earns points equal to their team's score
- Example: If your team scores 7 points, you earn 7 points (even if you lose 7-6)

### Leaderboard Rankings
Players are ranked by:
1. **Points Per Game (PPG)** - Primary ranking method
2. Head-to-head record (if tied on PPG)
3. Win rate percentage
4. Strength of schedule (quality of opponents)
5. Total matches played
6. Total points scored

### Finals
- Top 4 players compete: 1st+4th vs 2nd+3rd
- Uses the same scoring system as regular matches
- Same service rotation pattern
- Winner is crowned tournament champion

## Differences from Traditional Padel

This scoring system differs from traditional Padel tennis:

| Traditional Padel | Padel Indiano |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Games, sets, matches | Single game to X points |
| 15-30-40-game scoring | Simple numeric scoring |
| Deuce/advantage | No deuce - first to X wins |
| Service changes every 2 points | Service changes every point |
| Tied sets go to tiebreak | N/A - single game format |

## Why This System?

Benefits of the Indiano scoring system:
- ✅ **Simpler**: Easy to understand and track
- ✅ **Faster**: Games finish in predictable time
- ✅ **Fairer**: All players earn points based on performance
- ✅ **Flexible**: Adjustable to tournament time constraints
- ✅ **Inclusive**: Keeps all scores visible in rankings (no binary win/loss)
